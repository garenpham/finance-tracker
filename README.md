### Summary:

This is a full-stack MERN web application that I have learnt and developed as a personal project. The app assists people to monitor their incomes and expenses. It has a web server that uploads, retrieves, and processes the data from the MongoDB data center, then delivers the processed data to the client web app. Using Chart.js library, I have designed a graph to visualize the incomes and expenses more effectively for the user. The web server and the client app are deployed independently, and they can both be replicated to multiple services, in order to avoid single point of failure.
